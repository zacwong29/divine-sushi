                    <p>Here at Divine Sushi, we employ many expert chefs to help train AI models to prepare and cook
                        Japanese food at an advanced level. We want to provide the most unique eating experience 
                        possible for customers of our vending machines.
                    </p>
                    <p>We first started this venture because we loved Japan's many vending machines with
                        unexpected food types. Ice cream desserts, packed lunches, and burgers were just some
                        of the food items we were amazed to see in these machines. Surprisingly, there were 
                        not many sushi vending machines around. On the rare occasion that we found one, 
                        the sushi was stored frozen and required a microwave to heat it up. This didn't seem
                        like the greatest way to eat sushi, so it started sparking ideas in our heads.
                    </p>
                    <p>Once we started planning and developing our prototypes back in Australia, we finally came
                        up with Divine Sushi - the vending machine that cooks its own gourmet sushi, sashimi and ramen
                        within the machine itself in seconds.
                    </p>
                    <p>Our team is excited to share this product with the world and need help from local businesses
                        to start utilising our vending machines.
